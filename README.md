This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: directly modifying the response object using assignment instead of the appropriate methods provided by the Express.js framework.  The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect approach, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  Incorrectly modifying the response object can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.
